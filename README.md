# Dairy_Free_Coconut_Free_Ice_Cream_Recipe
This is a repository to simply hold a recipe for home made ice cream that does not contain dairy or coconut.

Yields ~2 pints

# Recipe
1.5 cup	Cashews 
2 2/3 cup	Almond Milk
1 cup 	Sugar Syrup (1 cup sugar, 1/2 cup water)
2 tbsp	Vanilla Extract
3.75 tbsp	Vodka
2.25 tsp	Sunflower Seed Oil
1/2 tsp	Salt

# Instructions
Boil 1/2 cup water and 1 cup sugar until there are no sugar grains visible.

Lob all ingredients into your blender jar.
If you have a low power blender, soaking the cashews in the mixture for a time (3-12 hours) will soften the cashews and ease the burden on the blender.

Blend thoroughly, very thoroughly.

Pour in your ice cream machine and churn until it's creamy.

Move the ice cream to your preferred container and freeze to harden slightly.

# Additional Notes
When adding flavors such as cookie dough or chocolate chips you can add them and run the churning for five or so minute to integrate thoroughly.

This is a good base to build and explore flavor options on. I've made good smores ice cream with graham cracker crunch, chocolate chip cookie dough, and even mixed in mocha syrup.
